    <h1>The best movies according to Mriganka</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>The Matrix</h3>
    <p>This is one of the greatest Sci-fi , movies of all time which inspire me to learn coding and make me think the world to be a simulation. I like the visuals there and also the beautiful dialogs.</p>
    <h3>Titanic</h3>
    <p>In cinema history hardly there is any love story movie like Titanic which focuses on love and separation like Titanic. The character potrail was epic and this movie has stood the tide of time like the strongest iceberg.</p>
    <h3>Guru</h3>
    <p>Many many not agree with me about this selection. But this movie inspires me to start a business and to be a strong character at any given point in time. I love this move with Abhishek Baccan performing the main character very beautifully.</p>
